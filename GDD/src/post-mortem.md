## Conclusion

This project took 6 hours to make, which was the available time.
It is missing a layer of depth, such as a small rock-paper-scissors type of
system in the battle part, and it also needs more clarity in that section of the GDD.

### Summary of Impressions

- The project was completed within a limited timeframe.
- The core loop is functional, but the battle system lacks depth.
- The Game Design Document (GDD) could benefit from clearer explanations,
- particularly in the battle mechanics section.

### Suggested Changes and Improvements for the Next Iteration

1. **Enhance Battle System:**
    - Introduce a rock-paper-scissors mechanic to add strategic depth to battles.
    - Consider additional mechanics or abilities that can influence battle outcomes.

2. **Improve GDD Clarity:**
    - Provide detailed explanations of the battle mechanics.
    - Include diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate complex systems.
