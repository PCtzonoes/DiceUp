# Game Design Document: DiceUP RPG Lite

## Game Overview

**Title:** DiceUP  
**Genre:** Hybrid-Casual / RPG / Idle Game  
**Platform:** Online / Mobile

**Description:**  
DiceUP is a blend of *Tap Titans* and *Monopoly Go*. Players take on the role of dice in a tabletop RPG store, striving
for fame as the luckiest dice. The game combines the thrill of rolling dice with strategic resource management and
character progression.

**Target Audience:**  
Casual gamers, RPG enthusiasts, fans of classic board games, and D&D players.

## Key Features & Mechanics

Players will roll themselves during two types of battles: PvE and PvP Raids, earning resources for upgrades. Since the
player is represented as a die, the battles are fought for NPCs they are rolling for.

### Core Loop

1. **Roll Dice:** Tap to roll the dice and receive a brief snippet of the battle.
2. **Battle:** Watch the battle unfold in an engaging RPG background.
3. **Resource Collection:** Earn resources based on the battle outcome.
4. **Upgrade:** Use resources to enhance character stats and unlock new abilities.

### Player Stats and Resources

- **_Luck:_** A key stat that affects roll effectiveness, influenced by upgrades and abilities.
- **_Fame:_** A secondary stat essential for progression unlocks and leaderboard rankings.
- **_Dice Dust:_** Soft currency for upgrades and abilities, earned primarily through rolls and passively over time.
- **_Momentum:_** Energy for battles that recharges over time, influenced by upgrades.
- **_Raid Tickets:_** Currency for PvP Raids, available for purchase or earned through rolls.

#### Battle System

##### PvE Battles

Each roll results in a battle for an RPG store NPC, with the player's die rolling on their behalf. The NPC will have a
random Initiative value based on encounter difficulty. Players must roll higher than the NPC's value to win the battle,
providing the NPC with a chance to win as well. Encounter difficulty is influenced by the player's _Fame_ and _Luck_.

### Progression Systems

Players will spend _Momentum_ to **Roll Dice**, resulting in _Dice Dust_ and _Fame_. _Dice Dust_ can be spent to
**Upgrade** the dice, enhancing their _Luck_ and unlocking new abilities. _Fame_ is used to unlock new upgrades,
battles, and progress through the game, while _Raid Tickets_ are used to **Raid** other players, earning **Fame**
and stealing **Dice Dust**, fostering competition and social interaction.

## Monetization Strategy

- **In-Game Purchases:** Buy skins for the dice (possibly with boosts), raid tickets, and other cosmetics.
- **Ad Integration:** Option to watch ads for temporary boosts in _Fame_ and _Dice Dust_ earnings.
- **Battle Pass:** Monthly subscription for exclusive rewards and boosts, would use CoDs are reference.
