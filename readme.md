# DiceUP - Prototype Repository

## Overview

**DiceUP** is a hybrid-casual RPG and idle game where players take on the role of dice in a tabletop RPG store, striving
for fame as the luckiest dice. This prototype showcases a small slice of the game, built in WebGL for convenience and
deployed on itch.io. It was developed in one day.

## Game Description

DiceUP combines the thrill of rolling dice with strategic resource management and character progression. Players will
roll themselves during two types of battles: PvE and PvP Raids, earning resources for upgrades. The battles are fought
for NPCs that the players' dice are rolling for.


## Deployment

This prototype is built in WebGL and deployed on itch.io for easy access and testing.
